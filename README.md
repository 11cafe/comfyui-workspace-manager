Finally, you can **manually save** your workflow by either click the üíæ floppy disk icon beside the workflow name or Shift+S shortcut (you can customize this shortcut in Settings)
Everytime you save, it will create a new record in **Version History** (you can access this in the dropdown menu on the left side of the name topbar)

## FAQ

### Where are my workflow and workspace data stored?

üç∫ All your workflows are now output to a folder in `/ComfyUI/my_workflows` ‚ö†Ô∏èNote: this is a ONE-WAY sync folder, that will only reflect changes made from your ComfyUI workspace browser; If you add some files manually using your OS file system (e.g. Finder in MacOS, File Explorer in Windows), workspace manager will not be able to pickup those changes. You need to use the "Import" button in files side bar to add new files to workspace manager.

Our internal db data is stored in your disk under /ComfyUI/custom_nodes/comfyui-workspace-manager/db/

## Upcoming Features

1. 1-Click Install Models
   Often when you import a json workflow from online, it will show lots of missing nodes or models errors, we will provide easy one-click install for missing models from Hugging face and Civiti

2. Modular
   Modern software development project are all modularized, the whole system is broken down into different modules. In ComfyUI each custom node is a module and should be self contained and easy to install and depend on from other modules. So that the modules (custom nodes) can be easily reused across projects.
   ‚û°Ô∏è We need something like web bundler, e.g. webpack, vite. This will make each custom node self contained and has a clear definition of its dependency.

3. Multi workflow project
   Now you can only work on one workflow at a time, this limits the potential to build large scale workflows that consists multiple sub-workflows parts. Each workflow can be seen as a custom node. You should be able to easily convert one workflow into one custom node. You can reuse workflow/custom node across your project.
   ‚û°Ô∏è We need a cross workflow, project management tool, like VSCode editor

4. Cloud running / easy deployment
   Right now you need to have python and GPU server up to run ComfyUI or Automatic111, that‚Äôs really painful for people who do not own a GPU. You should be able to run UI independently without paying for GPUüí∞.
   ‚û°Ô∏è Share and deploy your workflow to cloud in 1click and other people can easily run in browser using cloud GPU with no setup. It should be as easy as running Google Docs or Figma.
