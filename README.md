### Where are my workflow and workspace data stored?

üç∫ All your workflows are saved in a folder in `/ComfyUI/my_workflows`, you can change this path in settings. 

‚ö†Ô∏èNote: this is a ONE-WAY sync folder by default, that will only reflect changes made from your ComfyUI workspace browser; If you add some files manually using your OS file system (e.g. Finder in MacOS, File Explorer in Windows), workspace manager will not be able to pickup those changes. You need to use the "Import" button in files side bar to add new files to workspace manager.

Our internal db data is stored in your disk under `/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/comfyui-workspace-manager/db/` We also store a backup copy of your db data in your browser cache in case you lose your workspace data when deleting comfyui-workspace-manager and reinstall. Press F12 or Inspect in right click browser menu, go to Application -> IndexedDB -> WorkspaceDB to see your data

### How do I save my workflow?
Save your workflow by either clicking the üíæ floppy disk icon button or ‚å®**Shift+S** shortcut (customize this shortcut in Settings)
Every time you save, it will create a new record in **Version History**. You can go back and switch versions in version history like git.

By default, We also enabled auto-saving your current workflow as a cache in case you forgot to save it manually. It will NOT affect or change your manually saved versions. You can always click **"Discard unsaved changes"** to instantly revert back to your last manually saved version.

‚ÄºÔ∏è**You can disable this auto-saving behabior in Settings:**

**Looking for colaborators and coworkers** to develop this ComfyUI project management tool. If you know React, Python or ML model deployment, please reach out to weixuanfu01@gmail.com We want to make it easy to **manage, share and deploy** ComfyUI project.

## Upcoming Features

1. 1-Click Install Models
   Often when you import a json workflow from online, it will show lots of missing nodes or models errors, we will provide easy one-click install for missing models from Hugging face and Civiti

2. Modular
   Modern software development project are all modularized, the whole system is broken down into different modules. In ComfyUI each custom node is a module and should be self contained and easy to install and depend on from other modules. So that the modules (custom nodes) can be easily reused across projects.
   ‚û°Ô∏è We need something like web bundler, e.g. webpack, vite. This will make each custom node self contained and has a clear definition of its dependency.

3. Multi workflow project
   Now you can only work on one workflow at a time, this limits the potential to build large scale workflows that consists multiple sub-workflows parts. Each workflow can be seen as a custom node. You should be able to easily convert one workflow into one custom node. You can reuse workflow/custom node across your project.
   ‚û°Ô∏è We need a cross workflow, project management tool, like VSCode editor

4. Cloud running / easy deployment
   Right now you need to have python and GPU server up to run ComfyUI or Automatic111, that‚Äôs really painful for people who do not own a GPU. You should be able to run UI independently without paying for GPUüí∞.
   ‚û°Ô∏è Share and deploy your workflow to cloud in 1click and other people can easily run in browser using cloud GPU with no setup. It should be as easy as running Google Docs or Figma.

## Beta Preview
We're constantly pushing new features in beta branch, and only wait til it's thoroghly tested then push it to main. But if you would like to join our Beta Preview Program, you can receive latest feature updates pre-launch! Here is how to switch to beta, it requires you have some basic knowledge about command line and git.
- Make sure you have [git installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Open your terminal, go to the ComfyUI directory (where you usually start your python server by `python main.py`
- in ComfyUI root directory, `cd custom_nodes && cd comfyui-workspace-manager`
- inside custom_nodes/comfyui-workspace-manager, do `git fetch origin beta && git checkout beta`, you should see something like:
```
From https://github.com/11cafe/comfyui-workspace-manager
 * branch            beta       -> FETCH_HEAD
Switched to branch 'beta'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/beta'.
```
- now go back to ComfyUI restart your python server by `python main.py`

‚ÄºÔ∏è Be careful that beta branch can be unstable, so please please make sure you have backups for all your workflows! **Before switching to beta, please make a copy of these folders somewhere:**

`ComfyUI/custom_nodes/comfyui-workspace-manager/db`
or for extra safety, you can make a copy of the entire `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/comfyui-workspace-manager/` folder

if anything goes wrong, you can always paste back these folders. Also, you should have your /my_workflows folder (workspace save directory) in safe place always


If anything goes wrong, and you want to revert back to main, please do the following:
- inside custom_nodes/comfyui-workspace-manager, do `git checkout main`, then restart your python server and you are back into main branch!
